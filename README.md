## Questions to Explore: 
-- How does customer age and gender influence their purchasing behavior? 
-- Are there discernible patterns in sales across different time periods?
-- Which product categories hold the highest appeal among customers? 
-- What are the relationships between age, spending, and product preferences? 
-- How do customers adapt their shopping habits during seasonal trends? 
-- Are there distinct purchasing behaviors based on the number of items bought per transaction? 
-- What insights can be gleaned from the distribution of product prices within each category?
